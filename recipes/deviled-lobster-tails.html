        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Deviled lobster tails are a luxurious and flavorful seafood dish that elevates classic lobster with a 
            rich, spiced topping. The lobster tails are split and lightly cooked before being topped with a savory 
            mixture of butter, breadcrumbs, Dijon mustard, paprika, and aromatic seasonings. This topping creates a 
            golden, slightly crispy crust when baked or broiled, adding a delightful contrast to the tender, 
            succulent lobster meat. Often finished with a squeeze of fresh lemon and a sprinkle of parsley, deviled 
            lobster tails offer a perfect balance of richness, spice, and freshness, making them an elegant choice 
            for special occasions or gourmet dining at home.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/4 cup mayonnaise</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped tarragon</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of sriracha sauce</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of ground paprika</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of lemon juice</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon of ground cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>1 pinch of salt</li>
            <li>4 frozen lobster tails - thawed, split in half, and deveined</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix mayonnaise, tarragon, sriracha sauce, paprika, lemon juice, cayenne pepper, and salt together in 
                a bowl.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C). Set oven rack about 8 inches from the heat source and 
                preheat the oven's broiler.</li>
            <li>Loosen lobster meat from the shell, leaving it attached near the tip of the tail. Place tails on a 
                baking sheet lined with crinkled aluminum foil to help keep them in place.</li>
            <li>Spoon some of the mayonnaise mixture beneath the lobster meat and spread a generous amount on top.</li>
            <li>Broil in the preheated oven until lobster tails are browned and cooked through, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
