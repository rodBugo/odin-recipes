        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Bacon-wrapped scallions are a delicious and savory appetizer that combines the smoky, crispy goodness 
            of bacon with the mild, slightly sweet flavor of fresh scallions. This dish is made by wrapping whole 
            scallions or scallion bundles in thin strips of bacon and then cooking them until the bacon is crispy 
            and golden brown. The contrast between the crunchy bacon and the tender, slightly caramelized scallions 
            creates a flavorful bite with a balance of saltiness and freshness. Often grilled, baked, or pan-seared, 
            bacon-wrapped scallions can be enjoyed on their own or paired with a dipping sauce, such as a tangy soy 
            glaze or a creamy garlic aioli, making them a perfect addition to any appetizer spread or barbecue.</p>
